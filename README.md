 #**FORKING A REPOSITORY ON GITHUB**



Creating a fork is producing a personal copy of someone else's project. Forks act as a sort of bridge between the 
original repository and your personal copy. you can submit a pull request to help make other peoples projects better
by offering your changes up to the original project. Forking is at the core of social coding at GitHub


 Step 1. Got to GitHub.com and create a user account

 Step 2. assuming you know what kind of code you are looking for or there may be a project that you want to contribute
            to, navigate to your desired intrest of code on GitHub
    
 Step 3. once your on the disired users page click the fork button on the right side of page under the notification tab
            and to the right of the star tab

 Step 4. a box will pop up labeled "Fork Githubintro" and will display "Where should we fork Githubintro?". Here will be 
            multiple destinations you can pick from.
                    -this will be different for everone considering on the users account activity
            click the desired location you want your code to be uploaded to

 Step 5. this will bring you to a page that displays "Fork (name of repo)"

 Step 6. now you can see the exact same repo that you requested, where you wanted it uploaded at.

 Step 7. once you have open and eited the repo you requested. you can now commit changes either to:
                    A. Master
                    B. Create a new branch

 Step 8. commit pull requests to project owner, if a project owner likes the changes they cna pull fixes


##**FORKING DEFINED**

**Fork**: is a copy of a "repo" that you can manage.
            -Forks let you make change to a project with out affecting the original "repo"
            you can fetch up dates or submit changes with "pull-request"
**Repositories**: A directory or storage space where your project can live. sometimes known as "repo"
            - It can be a local foler on your computer, or it can be storage on GitHub or other on 
            live hosts. You can keep code files, text files, or image files as well.

**Pull-Requests**: requesting someone to pull your code into the main code
            -you dont have the right to access repositories without a fork
            you can access other pull requests to see other peoples contributions to code
            (here you can see what branches were accessed)

**GitHub pull Requests**: pull requests let you tell others about code you have pushed to a branch in a on get hub.
            -once you a pull reques is opened, you can discuss and review the potential changes with collaborators 
            and add follow-up commits before your changes are merged in the branch
                
  -*Branches*: is a unique set of code changes with a unique name
                        A. Each "repo" can have one or more branches 
                        B. The main Branch is where all the changes get merged back to, called master

**Git Global Information Tracker**: is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything 
from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.
